## Projects
### Investigating Fake News: Role of Emotions and Sentiments on the Spread of Misinformation
[Publication](https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/projects/3r075228j)

Developed a comprehensive analysis framework for examining the spread of various types of misinformation on Twitter following the death of a young Iranian girl, Mahsa Amini. This study utilized **Python** libraries such as **NLTK, NRCLEX for emotion analysis, and VADER for sentiment analysis** to process a dataset of tweets tagged with #MahsaAmini over a three-month period. By employing binomial logistic regression and negative binomial regression analyses, the research model illuminated the determinants of misinformation behaviors during social crises, drawing on frameworks of rumor mongering and rumor/truth diffusion. The findings highlighted a prevalence of negative messages, with extreme negative emotions like fear and anger receiving the highest scores. Statistically significant results from regression analyses supported hypotheses related to the spread and believability of misinformation. This interdisciplinary study bridges information systems, communication, and political science, providing a robust model for future research and practical interventions aimed at combating misinformation.

### Predictive Analysis of Heart Disease Using Big Data Mining Techniques
[Project](https://github.com/danicachin/portfolio/tree/main/Heart%20Disease)

In this group project, we explored the process of classifying potential heart disease using **big data mining** techniques. Working with a dataset of 70,000 patient records, we cleaned the data and used logistic regression and random forest models to identify key predictors of cardiovascular disease. The final dataset, consisting of 68,885 records, revealed that age, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol were the most significant indicators. Our models achieved an accuracy rate above 72%, with the random forest slightly outperforming logistic regression. The project highlights the importance of early prediction in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs, though it also notes limitations such as the need for more variables and precise data for better real-world application.

### Developing a Comprehensive Data Management Project for Home Insurance: A Case Study in Database Design and Data Warehouse Development
[Presentation](https://github.com/danicachin/portfolio/blob/main/Home%20Insurance/6220-%20Database%20Project_presentation%20.pdf)

Developed a comprehensive data management project focused on the home insurance business domain as part of the GBA 6220 Group Project – Data Modeling & Data Warehouse course. Our team conducted a detailed initial study to identify the scope and business rules, followed by creating conceptual and logical database designs. We implemented the database with relevant tables, loaded real-world data, and utilized SQL throughout the entire process for querying and managing data. Additionally, we built a data warehouse to support decision-making, designing ER diagrams with necessary entities, facts, and dimensions. Utilizing **Microsoft BI** tools, we created insightful artifacts and presented our findings, demonstrating our proficiency in **SQL, database design, and data warehouse development**.
